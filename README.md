# 🏦 Horizon — Modern Fintech Banking Platform

Horizon is a **production-grade online banking platform** designed to mirror how real-world fintech systems are architected, built, and operated.

This is **not a demo project** or a toy budget tracker.  
Horizon prioritizes **correctness, security, scalability, and observability**, aligning closely with modern digital banking and financial SaaS standards.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

Horizon simulates a modern digital bank experience, including:

- Secure user authentication and onboarding
- Multi-bank account aggregation
- Real-time balances and transaction syncing
- Peer-to-peer money transfers using real payment rails
- Server-first architecture with strong data integrity guarantees

Every design decision favors **system reliability over shortcuts**.

---

## 🧠 Core Architectural Principles

- **Server-first execution**  
  All sensitive logic is executed on the server using Next.js Server Actions.

- **Atomic operations**  
  Critical financial workflows either fully succeed or fully fail.

- **Clear trust boundaries**  
  The browser acts as a UI shell; business logic never leaks client-side.

- **Production-grade observability**  
  Errors and performance issues are traceable by default.

- **Separation of concerns**  
  User identity, financial data, and money movement are intentionally decoupled.
